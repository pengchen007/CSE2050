### First read the following function that caculates the Fib numbers
def fib(k):
    if k in {0, 1}: return k
    return fib(k-1) + fib(k-2)

for i in range(20):
    print(i, fib(i))

### The above function correctly calculates the Fib numbers as shown
### by the print statements above

### We are interested in how many function calls are made to calculate
### each Fib number
### We modify the above function to accomplish that

### Try to undertand the following code and see how the above goal
### is accomplished


def fib1(k):
    if k == 0: return 0, 1
    if k == 1: return 1, 1
    u = fib1(k-1)
    v = fib1(k-2)
    return u[0] + v[0], u[1] + v[1] + 1

for i in range(20):
    print(i, fib1(i))

### From the printout above, you should see that the number of function calls
### to calculate the Fib numbers are staggering
### Try to visualize on paper how each of these function call is made
    
### From the print out can you convince yourself that the number of function
### calls are exponential in terms of k?


### In fact, we can calculate Fib numbers using way less function calls
### We will now implement a goodfib function so that the number of function
### calls are linear
### In the return statement, the last parameter is the number of calls
### You can guess the meaning of the first two parameters from our class notes
### and slides

def goodfib(k):
    if k == 0: return 0, 0, 1
    if k == 1: return 1, 0, 1
    u = goodfib(k -1)
    return u[1]+u[0],u[0],u[2]+1
    ### fill in one line of code here to finish the goodfib function


for i in range(2000):
    print(i, goodfib(i))
